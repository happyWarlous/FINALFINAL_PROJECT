City's breakin' down on a camel's back
They just let it go 'cos they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cos you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss it, 'cos I don't get sleep, no
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
